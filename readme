Marketing Campaign Data Analysis

Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing a marketing campaign dataset to understand customer behavior and identify potential “ideal customers.” It includes steps for data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and extracting actionable insights, but no machine learning models are involved.

The analysis is part of a postgraduate project, aiming to provide a structured and comprehensive exploration of the data.

Dataset

The dataset used is the Customer Personality Analysis dataset, sourced from Kaggle:
Customer Personality Analysis Dataset.

Key Steps:

	1.	Data Cleaning:
	•	Handling missing values, duplicates, and inconsistent data.
	•	Feature engineering for deeper analysis.
	2.	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
	•	Visualizing distributions and trends within the data.
	•	Analyzing relationships between key features like customer demographics and purchasing patterns.
	3.	Insights Generation:
	•	Profiling customer segments based on spending, demographics, and campaign response.

Technologies Used:

	•	Python
	•	Pandas
	•	NumPy
	•	Matplotlib
	•	Seaborn

How to Run the Project:

	1.	Clone the repository.
	2.	Install necessary dependencies using requirements.txt.
	3.	Open the Jupyter notebook and follow the steps outlined for data cleaning and exploratory analysis.




Notebook Structure Outline

0. Preparation of the Environment

	•	Import Required Libraries: Import all necessary libraries at the beginning of the notebook.
	•	Data Loading: Introduce the data file, read it into a DataFrame.
	•	Initial Data Exploration: Display the first few rows, data types, and basic statistics to understand the dataset structure.

1. Data Cleaning

	•	Handling Missing Data: Identify and treat missing values according to the best approach for your data (e.g., imputation, deletion).
	•	Handling Duplicates: Check for and remove duplicate records.
	•	Correcting Data Types: Ensure each column has the appropriate data type.
	•	Handling Outliers: Identify and treat outliers appropriately.
	•	Document Each Step: Each data cleaning step should be well-documented with text explaining the rationale and the methods used.

2. Data Processing

	•	Normalization/Standardization: Apply necessary scaling techniques if required for your analysis.
	•	Encoding Categorical Variables: Use techniques like one-hot encoding for nominal data where necessary.
	•	Re-check of Data: Post processing, display the data to ensure all transformations are applied correctly.

3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

	•	Visualizations: Create histograms, box plots, scatter plots, etc., to visualize distributions and relationships in the data.
	•	Summary Statistics: Provide a statistical summary for numerical attributes (mean, median, mode, standard deviation, etc.).
	•	Correlations: Explore correlations between features, using correlation matrices or scatter plots.
	•	Documentation: For each plot or statistical summary, include a block of text that discusses the findings and any insights or anomalies observed.

4. Data Analysis

	•	Deeper Analysis: Based on the exploratory analysis, dive deeper into specific trends or patterns observed.
	•	Hypothesis Testing: If applicable, perform statistical tests to support or reject hypotheses.
	•	Model Building: If this is part of your project, build predictive or clustering models.
	•	Validation: Validate the findings or model predictions using appropriate metrics or methods.

5. Conclusion

	•	Summarize Findings: Clearly summarize the insights and findings from the analysis.
	•	Discuss Implications: Talk about the implications of your findings in the context of the problem.
	•	Future Work: Suggest areas for further research or how the analysis could be extended.
